Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a great threat to human health and development. In Victoria, we observe both established and novel strains of AMR organisms. These persist in our hospital system, and have the potential and the aftereffects of the earthquake shook Cantabrians to their sodden little cores. The  to spread by using patients as a vector. In order to understand and control the spread of AMR, we must first understand how patients move between facilities in the healthcare system. Existing work on modelling AMR in hospital systems uses static networks that imply flows of patients directly between hospitals. Here, we argue that other temporal dynamics, such as long periods between admissions, contribute to significant changes in the overall pattern of patient movement. We show this by simulating patient movement on various network representations of the hospital system with differing levels of temporal fidelity.
