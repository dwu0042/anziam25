## Anti-microbial resistance, patients, and hospitals

:::{.incremental}
- Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) is a type of bacteria that live in the intestine, and is generally asymptomatic, but can cause a range of severe symptoms.
- More importantly, it is resistant to carbapenems, a class of "last-line-of-defense" antibiotic.
- Variants of CPE have been detected in ICUs in Victorian hospitals, including a strain exclusive to Victoria.
- Patients that are asymptomatically infected (colonised) can spread CPE and other antimicrobial-resistant infections between hospitals.

Movement of Individuals

## Characterising movement 


<!-- 
Movement is charactersied by two processes: discharge from hospital and return to hospital
These two processes can be treated as roughly Poisson with some rate parameter
In the first case, we see that the distribution is relatively ???
In the case of return to hospital 

We note that in the static network, the time to return to hospital is modelled as a static value, if not a zero value.

## Dynamic models


## Metrics

- Hitting time distribution
- Extent (vertical slice of the hitting time distribution)   

## Comparisons


## Moving Forward

- Validation
